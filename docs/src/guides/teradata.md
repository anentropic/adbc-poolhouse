# Teradata guide

!!! note "Not yet implemented"
    `TeradataConfig` is planned but not yet implemented. The page below describes
    what will be available when support is added.

The Teradata ADBC driver is distributed via the ADBC Driver Foundry, not PyPI.

Teradata support — including `TeradataConfig` and the matching ADBC driver integration
— is planned for a future release. Track progress or request prioritisation on the
[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/anentropic/adbc-poolhouse/issues).

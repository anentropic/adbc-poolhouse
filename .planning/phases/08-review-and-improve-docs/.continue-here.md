<current_state>
Phase 8 is fully complete (6/6 plans, verification passed 14/14). All 8 milestone phases done.
Working tree is clean. Branch is 35 commits ahead of origin/main — not yet pushed or tagged.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

**Phase 8 plans (all done this session):**
- 08-01: close_pool() and managed_pool() added to public API
- 08-02: Existing docs updated — zero _adbc_source refs, ADBC driver table, pool tuning section
- 08-03: git-cliff changelog generated (140 lines, 7 groups)
- 08-04: DuckDB, BigQuery, PostgreSQL, FlightSQL guide pages
- 08-05: Databricks, Redshift, Trino, MSSQL, Teradata guide pages
- 08-06: mkdocs.yml nav updated with Warehouse Guides sub-section; strict build passes

**Quick tasks completed today:**
- quick-2: justfile with `build` and `serve` recipes
- quick-3: Foundry driver pages now link to ADBC installation guide
- quick-4: managed_pool example moved under "Disposing the pool" (not pytest section)
- quick-5: mkdocs hot-reload fix (`--livereload` flag required on macOS)
- Misc: mkdocs watch block committed (src/adbc_poolhouse + docs/src)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

No planned phase work remains. Potential next steps:
- Cut the v0.1.0 release: `git tag v0.1.0 && git push origin main --tags`
- Verify GitHub environments (testpypi, pypi) are configured for trusted OIDC publishing before tagging
- Run `/gsd:audit-milestone` before archiving if desired
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- close_pool/managed_pool as standalone functions (not pool methods) — QueuePool is SQLAlchemy's class, can't add methods without subclassing
- git-cliff requires `--config .cliff.toml` flag in v2.12.0 (leading-dot not auto-discovered)
- collections.abc moved into TYPE_CHECKING block (ruff TC003 — lazy annotations make it type-check-only)
- mkdocs hot-reload requires explicit `--livereload` flag on macOS (silently doesn't start without it)
- mkdocs serve uses 127.0.0.1 not 0.0.0.0 (livereload websocket more reliable on loopback)
</decisions_made>

<blockers>

None. All work is committed and clean.
</blockers>

<context>
Milestone v1.0 is functionally complete. The only outstanding action is cutting the release. The release pipeline (release.yml) is fully automated — push a semver tag and it handles build → validate → TestPyPI → PyPI → docs deploy. GitHub environments need to be verified before tagging.
</context>

<next_action>
Verify GitHub repo settings have `testpypi` and `pypi` environments with OIDC trusted publishing configured, then: `git tag v0.1.0 && git push origin main --tags`
</next_action>

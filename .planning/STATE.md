# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-23)

**Core value:** One config in, one pool out — `create_pool(SnowflakeConfig(...))` returns a ready-to-use SQLAlchemy QueuePool in a single call.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Pre-flight Fixes

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Pre-flight Fixes)
Plan: 1 of 1 in current phase
Status: Phase complete
Last activity: 2026-02-23 — Plan 01-01 executed

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 14%

## Performance Metrics

- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: ~1 min
- Total execution time: ~1 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-pre-flight-fixes | 1 | ~1 min | ~1 min |

**Recent Trend:**

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-roadmap]: `pre_ping=False` default (not True) — pre_ping silently no-ops on standalone QueuePool without a SQLAlchemy dialect; recycle=3600 is the connection health mechanism
- [Pre-roadmap]: Syrupy snapshots for Snowflake CI — real credentials used locally for recording; snapshots committed and replayed in CI without creds
- [Pre-roadmap]: `importlib.util.find_spec()` for driver detection — bare `except ImportError` swallows broken native extensions; find_spec distinguishes "not installed" from "installed but broken"
- [01-01]: detect-secrets fetched by prek from GitHub hook entry — NOT added to pyproject.toml dev dependencies
- [01-01]: Baseline generated with --exclude-files "^.planning/" to embed exclusion in filters_used and produce clean results: {} output
- [01-01]: exclude: .secrets.baseline mandatory in hook entry — SHA-256 hashes in baseline JSON trigger HexHighEntropyString/SecretKeyword detectors

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 4 (Driver Detection): Foundry driver path discovery mechanism in `adbc_driver_manager` is sparsely documented — needs implementation-time research against actual Foundry-installed driver paths (ADBC Driver Foundry launched Oct 2025)
- Phase 6 (Snowflake Snapshots): Custom syrupy serializer design needs validation against real Snowflake ADBC driver response format — metadata field names and Arrow schema structure must be verified before finalising serializer

<current_state>
Running `/gsd:complete-milestone v0.1`. Got through pre-flight check (audit exists, all 5 phases complete, progress 100%). Context exhausted before proceeding past readiness verification.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

This session completed all tech debt cleanup and Teradata removal before starting the milestone completion:

- Item 1 & 2: Updated Teradata warnings with Foundry status (not listed)
- Item 3: Eliminated `type: ignore[attr-defined]` in `_drivers.py` using `Any`
- Item 4: Deleted `_pool_types.py` (AdbcCreatorFn unused)
- Item 5: Removed dead `_adbc_driver_key()` abstract method from base + all 10 subclasses
- Item 6: Fixed DatabricksConfig docstring (URI-only, not decomposed fields)
- Item 7: Fixed PostgreSQL translator stale "Phase 5" comment
- Item 8: Fixed ROADMAP.md plan-level checkboxes ([ ] → [x] for phases 2-5)
- Removed all Teradata support entirely (no ADBC driver exists in Foundry)
- Renamed milestone v1.0 → v0.1 (matches pyproject.toml version = "0.1.0")
- All commits made, 82 tests passing, 0 type errors

Now starting `/gsd:complete-milestone v0.1` — stopped at step 0 (pre-flight passed).

<remaining_work>

Full complete-milestone workflow:
1. ✅ Pre-flight: audit exists (v0.1), status=tech_debt, no gaps — cleared to proceed
2. Verify readiness & present scope (5 phases, 17 plans, all complete)
3. Gather stats (git range, LOC, timeline)
4. Extract accomplishments from SUMMARY.md files
5. Run: `node gsd-tools.cjs milestone complete "v0.1" --name "Foundation"`
6. Evolve PROJECT.md (full review: What This Is, Core Value, Requirements Validated/Active, Key Decisions)
7. Reorganize ROADMAP.md (collapse phases 1-5 into milestone block, leave 6-7 as planned)
8. Delete original REQUIREMENTS.md
9. Git tag v0.1, offer push
10. Commit milestone completion
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Milestone name: "v0.1" (matches pyproject.toml version = "0.1.0", not "v1.0")
- Milestone scope: Phases 1-5 only (phases 6-7 are next milestone — Snowflake + docs/PyPI)
- Tech debt resolved: all 8 audit items addressed before archiving
- Teradata dropped: no ADBC driver exists in the Foundry; only supporting real drivers
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None — all clear to proceed with milestone completion.
</blockers>

<context>
The v0.1 milestone covers phases 1-5: pre-flight fixes, dependencies, config layer, translation/driver detection, pool factory + DuckDB integration. 82 tests pass, public API create_pool(DuckDBConfig(...)) is fully implemented. Phases 6-7 (Snowflake snapshots + docs/PyPI) are the next milestone.

Audit file: `.planning/v0.1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` — status: tech_debt, all 34 requirements satisfied, 5/5 phases passed.

PROJECT.md needs full evolution: move Active requirements to Validated (they shipped), update Key Decisions outcomes (all currently "— Pending"), update Context section, correct "Out of Scope" (BigQuery/PostgreSQL/etc. are actually implemented — the scope statement is stale from init).
</context>

<next_action>
Run `/gsd:complete-milestone v0.1` in a fresh context window. The workflow will handle everything — pre-flight will pass immediately, proceed to stats gathering and archival.
</next_action>
